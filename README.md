#### Problem Statement 

This repo is defining the systematic approach for solving a machine learning problem along with concept of computer vision with python for image manipulations. Repo consists of Italian covid datasets, for which we need analyze covid deaths monthly as well as geographically along with we have to ceate an user interface application with visualization within it. Deaths should be categorized as covid deaths and non covid.
